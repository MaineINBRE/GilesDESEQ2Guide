# Objective

Previously, we had aligned a set of RNA-seq reads to the _Mycobacterium smegmatis_ MC2 155 genome assembly and performed a basic analysis, resulting in a table of counts. Now we will perform an analysis on this table of counts to detect differentially expressed genes. To do this, we will use the `DESeq2` package from Bioconductor in `R`.

# Step 0: Installing `DESeq2`

`DESeq2` is a package from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org), an open source set of software tools in `R` for bioinformatics. If you don't already
